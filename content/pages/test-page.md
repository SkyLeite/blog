Hello! I'm Sky Leite, a 23 years old Software Engineer from Brazil.
Fascinated by programming from a very young age, my first "real" project was a
Discord bot used to alert users of random events in the japanese game Phantasy
Star Online 2. It was a moderate hit, and the fact that it impacted the lives of
so many people (including myself) was a huge influence on my career.

My goal with this blog is to share some of the knowledge I've gained over the
years, and also improve my writing. There's also a therapeutical aspect to it I
haven't figured out yet :P

If you wish to contact me, feel free to shoot me an email at [<mailto:sky@leite.dev>][sky.dev]].
